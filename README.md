# ETF_comparison
This project is the answer to a homework I had during my master. It tries to explain why a  l time leveraged  ETF would not perform the index as exactly 
the performance multiply by the leverage.

This project requires some knowledge about portofolio management and optimization. Report does not include a feed back on mathematical notions or fund management.
